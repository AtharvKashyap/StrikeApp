Based on iOS game Two Spies ; Created For A Hackathon

Description:
Strike is a turn based strategy pass and play game where you and another player will role play as two spies facing off in Latin America. The mission is simple: strike out your opponent. Traverse between cities, capture cities, and deduce your targets location to ultimately eliminate your opponent. Let the strikes begin!
